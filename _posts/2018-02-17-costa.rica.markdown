Costa Rica has long been a traveler's paradise, from low level treks in the jungle to ziplining up in the cloud forest, beautiful beaches and everything in between, there is something for everyone. Costa Rica is home to over 6% of the biodiversity on the planet and the flora/fauna and landscapes are amazing! Julie and I spent two weeks here in February of 2018. Pura Vida!
